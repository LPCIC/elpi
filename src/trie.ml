(*s A trie is a tree-like structure to implement dictionaries over
    keys which have list-like structures. The idea is that each node
    branches on an element of the list and stores the value associated
    to the path from the root, if any. Therefore, a trie can be
    defined as soon as a map over the elements of the list is
    given. *)


module Make (M : Map.S) = struct
  
(*s Then a trie is just a tree-like structure, where a possible
    information is stored at the node (['a option]) and where the sons
    are given by a map from type [key] to sub-tries, so of type 
    ['a t M.t]. The empty trie is just the empty map. *)

  type key = M.key list

  type 'a t = Node of 'a option * 'a t M.t

  let empty = Node (None, M.empty)

(*s To find a mapping in a trie is easy: when all the elements of the
    key have been read, we just inspect the optional info at the
    current node; otherwise, we descend in the appropriate sub-trie
    using [M.find]. *)

  let rec find l t = match (l,t) with
    | [], Node (None,_)   -> raise Not_found
    | [], Node (Some v,_) -> v
    | x::r, Node (_,m)    -> find r (M.find x m)

  let mem l t = 
    try Fun.const true (find l t) with Not_found -> false

(*s Insertion is more subtle. When the final node is reached, we just
    put the information ([Some v]). Otherwise, we have to insert the
    binding in the appropriate sub-trie [t']. But it may not exists,
    and in that case [t'] is bound to an empty trie. Then we get a new
    sub-trie [t''] by a recursive insertion and we modify the
    branching, so that it now points to [t''], with [M.add]. *)

  let add l v t =
    let rec ins = function
      | [], Node (_,m) -> Node (Some v,m)
      | x::r, Node (v,m) ->
        let t' = try M.find x m with Not_found -> empty in
        let t'' = ins (r,t') in
        Node (v, M.add x t'' m)
    in
    ins (l,t)

(*s When removing a binding, we take care of not leaving bindings to empty
    sub-tries in the nodes. Therefore, we test wether the result [t'] of 
    the recursive call is the empty trie [empty]: if so, we just remove
    the branching with [M.remove]; otherwise, we modify it with [M.add]. *)

  let rec remove l t = match (l,t) with
    | [], Node (_,m) -> Node (None,m)
    | x::r, Node (v,m) -> 
      try
        let t' = remove r (M.find x m) in
        Node (v, if t' = empty then M.remove x m else M.add x t' m)
      with Not_found ->
        t

(*s The iterators [map], [mapi], [iter] and [fold] are implemented in
    a straigthforward way using the corresponding iterators [M.map],
    [M.mapi], [M.iter] and [M.fold]. For the last three of them,
    we have to remember the path from the root, as an extra argument
    [revp]. Since elements are pushed in reverse order in [revp],
    we have to reverse it with [List.rev] when the actual binding 
    has to be passed to function [f]. *)
