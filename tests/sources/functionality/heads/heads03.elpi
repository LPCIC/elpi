% THIS IS OK:
% functionality relation of p is (Functional [Functional [Relational []]])
% functionality of r is (Functional [Functional []])
% (p r) is GOOD since first arg of p is `Functional [Relational []]`
% and Functional [Functional []] ⊆ Functional [Relational []]
% r (p r) is GOOD is first arg of r is `Functional []` and
% Functional [Functional [Relational []] ⊆ Functional []
r (p r).
